So it is daunting to think of writing a force balance on each and every particle (as well as to consider its detailed interactions with adjacent particles) to quantify the motion.  Fortunately, in the case of a rigid body, this can be all be circumvented and simplified by doing a moment balance on the body. The moment balance can be derived by taking the cross product of the differential momentum equation (aka, equation of motion, aka, stress equilibrium equation) with a position vector drawn from the center of mass, and integrating over the volume of the body."

Unfortunately, I don't have the same interest now as I did 4 years ago nevertheless, I will share my experience. I started my journey to learn about integration about 4 years ago in the second year of university. I thought I have some interest in integration and  might be good to push my knowledge from the basics to the advanced. My first step was to register in a forum and see how things work. I would post an integration question in the forum and someone said use the gamma function. To be frank, I faced all kinds of problems to collect the material needed to understand a single special function. This was the start of the journey. I suffered a lot to to understand all the basics and to move form one function to another. Actually sometimes you might find books on some special functions like the one by Lewin on polylogarithms and on the other hand suffer to collect some information about other functions like the theta function, loggamma integrals etc. I would say my process was slow but it eventually got me some way. I would suggest for you or anyone reading this post to start by the following materials because they are easy to understand ",

This is not easy, it might be a painful and very long road you have to assume, even going like that for years without getting the results you want.",
          "\nThat's a true fact you have to be aware of and accept it. I don't even mention that this way might seem such a nonsense for some of those around you, but you have to be extremely strong mentally and resist any attempt of being discouraged.",

          "Then remember one of the critical points, you're never in a competition with anyone, you only want to acquire better and better knowledge, indefinitely, reaching the highest peaks absolutely freely, being independent of the results by others. Don't spend time looking around and trying to compare yourself with anybody, and don't be scared by the way some manage to post solutions here, behind all is just a huge amount of work, you don't have to be a genius to do anything of what has ever been posted here. I'm confindent that you can do anything and far more if you truly want it.",
