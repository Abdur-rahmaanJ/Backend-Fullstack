{'answer': [['Suppose a man is running and he gradually speeds himself up . For this he applies a force on the ground backward and the ground pushes him forward . This is  probably due to to friction between the shoes of the man and the ground . The friction acting in this case is Kinetic friction which has a constant magnitude.  Since the magnitude of frictional force is constant, how is the man able to accelerate himself ?  Who is providing this force?', "Don't think kinetic friction, just because some part of him is moving. Is it also kinetic friction if I stand still but swing my arms?

If not, then it is not kinetic friction. If the shoe is not slipping, the bottom of the shoe is stationary with respect to the ground and the force being applied is static friction. Unless he's running on ice or a lubricated surface, it's unlikely he's experiencing kinetic friction.", 'The force of friction is not constant in this case. The force of static friction is only what is necessary to prevent slipping. Over the course of his stride, the force of friction changes.', "Acceleration occurs when the net force on an object is non-zero. Nothing else matters. It doesn't matter if the force is constant. It doesn't matter how many forces act on the object. It doesn't matter if the object is moving the same direction as the force. As long as the net force is non-zero, it will accelerate. In this case, there are only three objects acting on the runner: gravity, friction, and the normal force. Gravity is directed straight down, and the normal force is directed straight up (assuming flat, level ground). Friction acts horizontally to accelerate the runner.", "The magnitude of frictional force is not constant.He applies force inclinedly at ground whose reaction's horizontal component makes him move ahead and the vertical component equals his weight.\nThis friction is not kinetic friction as in the interval his one foot is at ground,he moves his body ahead but his foot remains in the same position.In next step same thing is repeated on the other leg.", 'For part of the stride the man is certainly exerting a force on the ground in the backward direction and the ground is exerting a force on the man in the forward direction which causes the man to increase his momentum and hence his velocity in the forward direction.', '\nThe frictional forces exist because the muscles of the man push the foot into the ground.', '\nIt matters not whether his foot is slipping or not relative to the ground except that a greater frictional force can be exerted on the man if there is no slipping.  ', 'So you have a series of impulses (force $\\times \\Delta$time) acting on the man due to the ground which increases his momentum and velocity.  ', 'I think that the interesting fact is that  for the other part of the stride the frictional force acting on the man due to the ground is actually in the opposite direction to that of his motion and imparts an impulse which tends reduce his momentum.', '\nThat is why a man can have a positive acceleration, move at "constant" velocity or have a negative acceleration.', '\nIt all depends on the magnitude and direction of the frictional force which on the mas at various phases of his stride.

I feel there is some more information required. I draw a velocity/time graph. Let the distance that the bus moves be $d$. The man's velocity is therefore: $v_{man}=\\frac{40+d}{20}$. The bus is accelerating at $f$ m/s for the same time of $20$ s. I get the expression: $d=200f$. I didn't know where to go from there. I combined the expressions to get $v_{man}=2+20f$.

In the limiting case, the man's speed would only need to be (40 m)/(20 s) = 2 m/s.", "If the bus accelerates quickly, then it should be obvious that the man can never catch it.  Whatever the speed the man is running at, it will take him a finite time just to get to where the bus started.  Clearly if the bus accelerates to the man's speed in that time, there is a gap between the man and the bus when the speed of the two match.  After that, the gap only widens.", 'Your answer assumes that "just catches" the bus implies that the man gets to the bus right at the time it would accelerate past his speed.  It\'s not clear to me that\'s what\'s meant, but if so, you do have the additional degree of freedom required to solve this problem.  In that case, you don\'t need to know the acceleration of the bus up front, and can infer it from the additional constraint.', 'You might want to check that this is really what is intended to be understood from "just catches".', 'Ah , the final velocity of the bus is the same as that for the man "just catches the bus".

', 'When they mention that speed they are speaking of the ', ' speed he will need to run in order to keep contact with the loop. I believe they calculated that number simply as a reference point so that 1) they knew looping the loop was theoretically possible, and 2) so he had an estimate of about how fast he needed to run.

Theoretically, the minimum velocity needed at the apex of the loop is the velocity which will result in a normal force of zero at that point. This means at the very top of the loop his feet would not be exerting any force upon the loop at all (meaning he would just ', ' make it through the apex without falling). You can see from the video that this is not the case. If you watch the slow motion clip his foot clearly ', ' against the track very near to the apex of the loop, meaning he must have been traveling faster than the theoretical minimum velocity.', 'So, in answer to your question, yes, running as fast as he could would have worked just fine, since that would clearly have been faster than the minimum velocity. Of course, the faster he runs the more leg strength he would need at the apex to resist the normal force of the track pushing down on him.', 'https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OTcdutIcEJ4', 'http://www.welt.de/vermischtes/article125146560/Erster-Mensch-der-Welt-rennt-einen-Looping.html'], ["To simplify the question we assume the same man run on a straight and flat road with constant speed.

I will really appreciated the help and thanks in advance!", "This question is an example of the role played by forces internal to a system.  In the case of the human body, complex chains of metabolic processes provide the energy used to contract muscles. Furthermore, different metabolic pathways with different efficiencies will be deployed depending on the human's speed, current dietary situation (does their body have access to carbohydrates?  Is the body burning more fat or ketones?), and many more variables.  This heavily complicates the question.  ", "Fortunately, to answer your question, we don't have to worry about that.  All we have to do is treat the human like a black box and measure its energetic expenditure in different situations.  For the sake of getting a clear answer, let us assume that we are dealing with an average human who just had a nice big plate of pasta the night before.  In this average case, we can say that a human has $S=.55m^2$, $C=1.16$, and that air has $\\rho=1.225 kg\\cdot m^{-3}$.  ( These values are from a very well sourced ", ')', "Now, let's compare two situations: 1) as in your posed question, we can consider only the force of air resistance at various speeds to calculate energy expenditure, and then 2) use measured values from the literature for the power required for an average human to maintain certain speeds to calculate the energy expenditure.  ", "1) First, let's consider a modest jog of 2.25 m/s. Using the quadratic drag force equation $F=\\frac{1}{2}C\\rho S V^2$, this yields a constant drag force of 1.98 if we assume there's no wind.  The work done is $$W=\\int_0^d{F\\cdot dx}=\\int_0^d{1.98dx}=1.98d$$\nwhere d is the distance traveled.

This is about 7% of the energy used to run the 5K itself!', '2) Following this ', ' we can do some very rough obsevations that show the difference between running at different speeds.  At 2.25 m/s, we see that a a 5K would take about 35 minutes to complete, so the energy expenditure would be somewhere around 350 kcal.  At 4.5 m/s, a 5K would take about 18.5 minutes and expend about 380 calories.  Now, the difference here may be small, but it of course scales as longer distances are ran.  ', 'Finally, we have to take into account the basal metabolic rate- the Harvard table does not separate this from its values.  If we assume that the runner is a 5\'8" man who is less than middle age and is 70 kg, he will have a BMR somewhere around 1700 kcal/day.  This means that his body will spend about 40 kcal while jogging for ~35 minutes at 2.25 m/s, and about 20 kcal while running the 5K at 4.5 m/s.   If we take this into account, the difference becomes $360\\ kcal- 310\\ kcal = 50\\ kcal$.', 'The absolutely simplest way to think about it concerns acceleration. The man has to expend metabolic energy accelerating to a given velocity, which is then dissipated as heat after the run and is not recovered into the metabolism.
