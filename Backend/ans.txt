In that case, you don\'t need to know the acceleration of the bus up front, and can infer it from the additional constraint.', 'You might want to check that this is really what is intended to be understood from "just catches".', 'Ah , the final velocity of the bus is the same as that for the man "just catches the bus".

Is the body burning more fat or ketones?), and many more variables.  This heavily complicates the question.  ", "Fortunately, to answer your question, we don't have to worry about that.  All we have to do is treat the human like a black box and measure its energetic expenditure in different situations.  For the sake of getting a clear answer, let us assume that we are dealing with an average human who just had a nice big plate of pasta the night before.

This is about 7% of the energy used to run the 5K itself!', '2) Following this ', ' we can do some very rough obsevations that show the difference between running at different speeds.  At 2.25 m/s, we see that a a 5K would take about 35 minutes to complete, so the energy expenditure would be somewhere around 350 kcal.  At 4.5 m/s, a 5K would take about 18.5 minutes and expend about 380 calories.  Now, the difference here may be small, but it of course scales as longer distances are ran.  ', 'Finally, we have to take into account the basal metabolic rate- the Harvard table does not separate this from its values.  If we assume that the runner is a 5\'8" man who is less than middle age and is 70 kg, he will have a BMR somewhere around 1700 kcal/day.  This means that his body will spend about 40 kcal while jogging for ~35 minutes at 2.25 m/s, and about 20 kcal while running the 5K at 4.5 m/s.
