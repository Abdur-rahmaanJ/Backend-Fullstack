{"answer": [["", " Answer: ", " sqrt{112} ", " Explanation: ", "According to question,when man moves with velocity 8 km/hr in x direction the rain falls vertically,", "That means rain have horizontal component of 8 km/hr,", "Let v be vertical component then the rain vector will =8i+vj \u00a0 ", "Now, if he increase his speed to 12 km/hr, rain will form 30 angle with vertical and relative velocity of man w.r.t rain in horizontal component will become 12 km/hr-8 km/hr=4 km/hr ", "Now tan 30=4/v", "thus, v=4 cot 30=4sqrt{3} ", "So velocity of rain wrt road is 8i-4sqrt{3}.
