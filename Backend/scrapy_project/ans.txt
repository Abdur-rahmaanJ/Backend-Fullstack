{'answer': [['Dear VaibhavLet the output of both engines be WLet the 1stengine take Q1heat as input at temperature T1= 900K and gives out heat Q2at temperature T the second engine receive Q2as input and give out Q3at temperature T3= 400k to the sink.Work done by first engine W = Q1– Q2Work done by 2nd engine W = Q2– Q3Thus,Q1– Q2= Q2– Q3Dividing both sides by Q11 – Q2/Q1= Q2/Q1– Q3/Q1=&gt; 1-T/T1= Q2/ Q1(1- Q3/ Q2)=&gt; 1-T/T1= Q2/ Q1(1- T3/ T)=&gt; 1-T/T1= T/T1(1- T3/ T)=&gt; T1/T – 1 = 1 - T3/ T=&gt; T1/T + T3/ T = 2=&gt; 1/T (T1+ T3) = 2=&gt;T = (T1+ T3)/2=&gt; T = (900+400)/2 = 650 KRegardsArun (askIITians forum expert)', 0]], 'domain': ['askiitans']}
